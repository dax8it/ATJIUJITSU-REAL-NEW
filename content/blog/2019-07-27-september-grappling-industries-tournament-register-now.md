We're happy and proud of everyone who put their jiu-jitsu skills out on the line and tested themselves. Great learning tool for all of us, win or lose. This tournament gave us the opportunity to analyze our jiu-jitsu and study the game. But the biggest thing that came out of the Grappling Industries Tournament was our team strength, resolve, and our tremendous support for each other. You guys rock!!
