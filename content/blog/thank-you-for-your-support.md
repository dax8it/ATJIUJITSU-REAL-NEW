We are humbled by our students who have come forward and continued their support online through great sacrifice on their own. We are grateful for your continued moral support throughout social media, emails and phone calls. The current situation has been difficult for everyone but it is thanks to you we are able to make it during this time. We hope to see everyone again once this is all over, and we miss you all! Thank you again for your continued support and please stay safe and healthy!

All the best!

Professor Alvaro
