We are humbled by our students who have come forward and continued their memberships and support through great sacrifice of their own, please know we will not be able to make it through without it. We are grateful for your continued moral support throughout social media, emails and phone calls. The current situation has been difficult for everyone but it is thanks to everyone that we are able to make it during this time and has helped us see the light at the end of this tunnel.  We hope to see you again once this is all over. Thank you again for your continued support and please stay safe and healthy!
