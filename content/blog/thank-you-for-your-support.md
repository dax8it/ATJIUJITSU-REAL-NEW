## We would like to thank everyone who has taken the time to join our virtual classes. We understand that the shift from learning live and in person to learning through a computer monitor has not been easy but we love the effort and time everyone has been putting in. Seeing everyones face and energy through the calls has managed to lift up our spirits and see the positive side of things during this difficult time. Thank you to everyone once again for the support, and we hope to see you all very soon!
