# Kids Outdoor Kickboxing

**Throughout the pandemic, we were unable to hold our regular instructional indoor classes, therefore we made it work with our outdoor classes program. The kids and adults got to experience Kickboxing and Muay-Thai in the outdoors on 34th avenue open streets. Thank you to all the kids who joined us and were out there with us running a mile every Saturday morning! You all put in that work and we hope it was all worth it! Be sure to join us for our regular instructional kickboxing and muay-thai classes indoor now.**
