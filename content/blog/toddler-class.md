The Dance Competition Team and Performance Group consists of advanced dancers ages 5 â€“ professional.These dancers were selected through an audition held during the Summer.The Competition Team is decided on upon the discretion of Melissa Covo. The dancers were chosen not only by age but ability. We attend several Dance Conventions/Competitions in and out of Alabama where the dancers take technique classes from Professional teachers from New York, Chicago, etc. At these conventions, the dancers are given many opportunities to win several different awards and scholarships.
