## 🎒Back to School, Back to the Grind

Hello Team,

What a summer! We hoped everyone had a great Labor Day weekend. We wanted to give a recap of how awesome this summer was!

Fall means routine. At first it feels like a grind… but on the mats, that grind is gold. Every class, every roll, every rep is progress. Structure gives us strength. Training turns pressure into growth.

Whether you’re a parent giving your child the gift of discipline, or an adult pushing yourself past limits, fall is the time to dig deep and build the best version of yourself.

🌟 Please stay tuned for details about our Kids In-House Tournament coming soon!

## Adults: Sharper Than Ever

This summer, our adults showed what dedication really looks like. From Kettlebell training to build power, to Muay Thai and Kickboxing for striking precision, and hours of drilling in both Gi and No-Gi Jiu-Jitsu—we didn’t slow down for a second.

Now, fall is here, and it’s time to lock in. Whether you’re chasing competition medals or personal milestones, our adult classes are where strength, skill, and confidence are forged.

Don’t just train—level up!

## Kids: Champions in the Making

Our kids also stayed razor sharp this summer! They showed incredible focus, effort, and heart while building the skills that will carry them on and off the mats. From takedowns and control to teamwork and discipline, they worked hard while having fun every step of the way.

As school kicks in, our kids’ program becomes a secret weapon. Jiu-Jitsu and Kickboxing keep kids active, disciplined, and confident.

Parents, this is the perfect time to give your child the structure and energy outlet they need to crush it in school and in life.

A huge congratulations to Francesca, who stepped up for a Superfight this summer—and dominated against an adult blue belt! Her hard work, discipline, and fearless mindset inspire all of us. She showed that age is just a number when dedication meets skill.

## Summer Camp Recap

Our Summer Camp was 6 weeks packed with action and creativity—kids launched bottle-cap rockets, built puppets to tell stories, and trained hard while having fun.

Thank you to every student, parent, and coach who made it unforgettable! Summer may be over… but the grind has just begun. 💪

See you on the mats,

@ Jiu-Jitsu NYC
