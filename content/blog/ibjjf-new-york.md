### Our ladies Alee and Kim have shown what it means to be champions at the IBJJF Tournament in New York. Alee fought hard and earned a well-deserved 3rd place among 8 girls in her division. Kim-lien, dominated the competition by winning gold in her division in both Gi & No Gi and earning a silver medal in the absolute division. We are beyond proud of their achievements and can't wait to see what the future holds for these two amazing athletes.
