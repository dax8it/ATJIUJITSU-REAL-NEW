**We would like to inform you that AT Jiu-Jitsu NYC is planning on offering an Eight week summer program filled with endless fun! Each week will be designed to empower and enlighten kids through amusing activities, fascinating and safe field trips, timely lessons in teamwork and so much more! Activities will include Jiu-Jitsu, Game Time, Shared Reading, Arts and Crafts, Hiking trips and more. All while of course, following the guidelines from the State.**

**We would also like to invite you all to read this article published by the Daily news on June 2nd in which Governor Cuomo has announced that summer day camps are allowed to open at the end of the month as the coronavirus crisis wanes.**

**In light of the corona virus outbreak, we will continue to add to our already rigorous health and safety protocols to our Academy as we make decisions about the summer season. We are continuing to monitor the situation and will of course be putting strict safety measures in place before welcoming the kids for the summer.**

**If you are interested please email us at atjiujitsunyc@gmail.com as the spots are limited! Thank you.**

**Check out some photos from our summer session from last year with activities such as laser tag, water balloon fights, Mario Kart tournaments, dodgeball, Jiu-Jitsu, arts and crafts, and trips to the pool, the library and museums, it was a summer we hope they'll never forget! Be sure to join us this year and we hope to see you all there!**
