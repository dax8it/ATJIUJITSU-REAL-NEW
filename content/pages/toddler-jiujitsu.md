# Toddler Jiujitsu


• Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is THE BEST non-violent self defense for children and teens. Our toddlers learn takedowns, throws, falling, controls. In the day-to-day classes, we take the punching/kicking element out of the equation and focus mainly on grappling. Through demonstration, students learn a series of techniques each day.

• In Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes, children will meet many new friends and share common experiences like drilling techniques, playing games, and live rolling.

• Classes begin at ages 3-4
