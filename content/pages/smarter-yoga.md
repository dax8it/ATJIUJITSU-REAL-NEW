# Smarter Yoga

## The best Yoga program for grapplers in Jackson Heights, NY!

* One of the best forms of rehab for jiu-jitsu practitioners is Yoga. Yoga for Grapplers includes dozens of exercises and sequences for every part of the body. There is particular focus on the neck, upper torso (shoulders, chest and upper back) and hips, as these are the tightest and most injury-prone areas for grapplers. Yoga improves flexibility and is needed after a grueling BJJ session where all you did was contract your muscles. Yoga is so much more than stretching.
* You can also learn many useful breathing techniques. Your breathing patterns can easily deteriorate when you train BJJ. There is so much to do and so much to think about in every rolling session that you may completely forget about the importance of breathing. Focusing on your breath encourages mindfulness and awareness, which is great during a roll. So come on over to AT Jiu-Jitsu NYC to take our smarter YOGA program.
