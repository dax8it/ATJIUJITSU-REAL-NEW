## Get ready for the ultimate summer experience — our Jiu-Jitsu Summer Camp is back, running from July 8th to August 15th!

## This is more than just a camp — it’s an incredible opportunity for your child to build confidence, learn discipline, and master the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu… all while having an unforgettable time!

## We’re also excited to offer an Extended Stay option this year!

## With this option, you can drop off your child as early as 9AM, and pick up as late as 5:30PM.

## Extended Stay includes both Kickboxing and Jiu-Jitsu classes on camp days for even more fun and training!

## Early registration ends June 1st, so don’t wait!

## You can now register directly through Gym Desk, or feel free to reach out to us and we’ll help you get set up.

## Thank you for your continued support.
