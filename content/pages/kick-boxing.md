### What differentiates kickboxing from Muay Thai? 

While both are striking martial arts that incorporate punches and kicks, they have distinct techniques, origins, and fighting stances. Muay Thai, known as the 'Art of Eight Limbs,' also incorporates elbows and knee strikes, emphasizing clinch fighting.

Kickboxing and Muay Thai are both prominent stand-up fighting styles, but they have distinct characteristics:

1. **Techniques:** Kickboxing focuses on punches, kicks, and footwork. In contrast, Muay Thai utilizes punches, kicks, elbows, knees, and clinching techniques.
2. **Stance:** Muay Thai fighters adopt a more upright stance, while kickboxers often use a side-on stance similar to traditional boxers.
3. **Origins:** Kickboxing has its roots in karate and boxing and became popularized in Japan and later in the U.S. Muay Thai is an ancient martial art from Thailand, deeply embedded in the country's culture.
4. **Rounds and Fight Duration:** Professional Muay Thai bouts usually have 5 rounds, while kickboxing can vary, often with 3 or 5 rounds.
5. **Cultural Significance:** Muay Thai has spiritual elements, with fighters performing the "Wai Kru" dance before bouts to respect their teachers. Kickboxing doesn't have such rituals.
