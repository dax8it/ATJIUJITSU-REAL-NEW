# Kickboxing

## The best kickboxing program in Jackson Heights, NY!

• Kickboxing is a form of martial arts derived from karate. It borrows moves from multiple types of martial arts including full-contact karate, Muay Thai, and boxing.

• Although the name implies kicking as a priority, this type of martial art uses both hands and feet as points of contact. Kicks and punches are both used during kickboxing.

• Kickboxing involves lots of rapid movement and can easily increase your heart rate to a similar pace as running.

• This type of training is called high-intensity interval training and has been shown to be especially good for burning calories and increasing cardiovascular fitness.
