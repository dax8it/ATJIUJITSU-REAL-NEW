• A highly-effective self-defense martial art. Contrary to the popular belief, Muay Thai is not the same as kickboxing. The two are often mistaken for one another, which is a common misconception. Although there are significant similarities between them, the key difference is that Muay Thai allows the use of elbows.

• Almost all Muay Thai movements involve rotating your hip with each kick, kicks below the waist are allowed, as well as grabbing your opponent’s leg mid-kick.

• Compared to regular boxing, which uses two contact points (two fists) or kickboxing (four points of contact), Muay Thai fighting style uses eight points of contact, utilizing every part of the body in both attack and defense mode.
