# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

• BJJ is a grappling-based martial art whose central theme is the skill of controlling a resisting opponent in ways that force them to submit. BJJ does not feature kicking or punching. Techniques of BJJ are centered round the skill of taking an opponent down to the ground and wrestling for dominant control positions from where the opponent can be rendered harmless.

• BJJ teaches one to defend themselves especially with opponents who might be bigger or stronger. This is done by utilizing superior leverage, grip and position upon your opponent.

• Students benefit from greatly increased physical fitness, problem-solving ability, self-knowledge of their body and mind and the many social benefits of working and growing with your classmates.

• A highly-effective self-defense martial art. Contrary to the popular belief, Muay Thai is not the same as kickboxing. The two are often mistaken for one another, which is a common misconception. Although there are significant similarities between them, the key difference is that Muay Thai allows the use of elbows.

• Almost all Muay Thai movements involve rotating your hip with each kick, kicks below the waist are allowed, as well as grabbing your opponent’s leg mid-kick.

• Compared to regular boxing, which uses two contact points (two fists) or kickboxing (four points of contact), Muay Thai fighting style uses eight points of contact, utilizing every part of the body in both attack and defense mode.

• Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is THE BEST non-violent self defense for children and teens. Our toddlers learn takedowns, throws, falling, controls. In the day-to-day classes, we take the punching/kicking element out of the equation and focus mainly on grappling. Through demonstration, students learn a series of techniques each day.

• In Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes, children will meet many new friends and share common experiences like drilling techniques, playing games, and live rolling.

• Classes begin at ages 3-5
