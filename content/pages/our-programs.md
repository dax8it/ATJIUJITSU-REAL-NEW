# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu


• BJJ is a grappling-based martial art whose central theme is the skill of controlling a resisting opponent in ways that force them to submit. BJJ does not feature kicking or punching. Techniques of BJJ are centered round the skill of taking an opponent down to the ground and wrestling for dominant control positions from where the opponent can be rendered harmless.

• BJJ teaches one to defend themselves especially with opponents who might be bigger or stronger. This is done by utilizing superior leverage, grip and position upon your opponent.

• Students benefit from greatly increased physical fitness, problem-solving ability, self-knowledge of their body and mind and the many social benefits of working and growing with your classmates.

# Muay Thai



• A highly-effective self-defense martial art. Contrary to the popular belief, Muay Thai is not the same as kickboxing. The two are often mistaken for one another, which is a common misconception. Although there are significant similarities between them, the key difference is that Muay Thai allows the use of elbows.

• Almost all Muay Thai movements involve rotating your hip with each kick, kicks below the waist are allowed, as well as grabbing your opponent’s leg mid-kick.

• Compared to regular boxing, which uses two contact points (two fists) or kickboxing (four points of contact), Muay Thai fighting style uses eight points of contact, utilizing every part of the body in both attack and defense mode.

# Kickboxing 

•Kickboxing is a powerful striking martial art that combines elements of traditional boxing with dynamic kicking techniques. It’s widely practiced for self-defense, sport, and fitness.

• Unlike Muay Thai, kickboxing typically does not allow elbows or clinching. The focus is on punches, kicks above the waist, and knee strikes (depending on the rule set).

• Movements emphasize speed, precision, and combinations, making it an excellent way to build coordination, endurance, and explosive power.

• While boxing uses two points of contact (fists) and Muay Thai uses eight, kickboxing uses four points of contact—two fists and two feet—offering a versatile and effective striking system.
