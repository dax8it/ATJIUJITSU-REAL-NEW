# **Academy Protocols:**

Students are required to follow training protocols for safety and the safety of others. 

* Students must remove their shoes before stepping onto the mat. NO SHOES on the mat.
* Students must arrive ON TIME to class. Arriving late is disrespectful to the Professor/Instructor.
* Students MUST BOOK every class ahead of time.
