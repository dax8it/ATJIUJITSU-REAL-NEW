# **Academy Protocols:**

Please read the following as it contains important information to follow at our gym. Students are required to follow training protocols for safety and the safety of others. 

* Students are expected to remove their shoes BEFORE stepping onto the mats. NO SHOES on the mats. 
* Wash hands prior to training and/or sanitize hands (RECOMMENDED).
* If you do not feel well and/or are nursing any injuries, please stay home and rest.
* Wipe your feet in the footbucket everytime before stepping onto the mats.
* Arrive to class ON TIME. Arriving late is a disrespect to the Professor/Instructor.
* Booking Class online is a REQUIREMENT in order to keep track of the attendance for the day.
* Register early for classes.
* Respect the WAITLIST, if you are put on a class waitlist, you cannot take class. You are welcome to attend and observe the class, but not to take class. This follows the importance of registering early for class!
* If you cannot attend class, CANCEL your class booking so that if someone is on the waitlist, they can take your spot in class. 
* Students that used any academy equipment is expected to spray down the gear and return to where it belongs. Please DO NOT leave any used equipment on the mats. 
* Students must clean up after themselves in the changing rooms, do not leave any discarded tissues, empty water bottles, tape, sweaty clothes on the floor or counter tops. 
* Students are required to own their own Kickboxing gear (Gloves & Shinguards) and Jiu-Jitsu (Gi's & No Gi Attire) once enrolled for a monthly program. Gi's & Kickboxing gear are meant for students on trial only. 
* If you do not have a Gi for the class, students must pay a $5 rental fee each time. 
* Students are encouraged to bring flip flops to leave at the gym.
