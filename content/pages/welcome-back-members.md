We would like to take the time to welcome back AT Jiu-Jitsu NYC members! It has been a long and tough road back, but we are happy to be opening our doors, starting with members only. Through this program, you will be able to book your class sessions through our online booking platform. It is very important that you do so in order to take classes.

Now that we have been given the green light to reopen, it is very important to sign up for Martial Arts On Rails. In the link below, there is a step by step video tutorial for how to do so if you have not yet done so or click on the link below.

# **Academy Protocols:**

## **\*\*We strongly recommend for everyone to get Covid tested monthly.\*\*** 

**We also ask you do not enter if you:**

**• Do not feel well • Are exhibiting any symptoms of COVID-19: mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough and difficulty breathing, or other symptoms identified by the CDC.
 • Have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days. • Are a high risk or vulnerable individual as described above.**

We want to assure our members that we are also taking every precaution necessary and your safety is our main concern. All our staff members have been tested for Covid-19 and will continue to do so with monthly tests. The Academy will be thoroughly cleaned every night and commonly touched surfaces will be wiped down periodically throughout the day. In addition, the academy will get steam cleaned 3 times a week. We trust that everyone training is healthy and safe in order to come in and take class
