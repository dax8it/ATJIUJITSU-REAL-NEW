We would like to take the time to welcome back AT Jiu-Jitsu NYC members! It has been a long and tough road back, but we are happy to be opening our doors, starting with members only. Through Martial Arts on Rails, you will be able to book your class sessions through our online booking platform. It is very important that you do so in order to take classes.

# **Academy Protocols:**

## **\*\*We strongly recommend for everyone to get Covid tested monthly.\*\***

**Students are recommended to:** 

**• Get Covid tested every month**

• Wear a clean mask at all times during training (Breaks allowed in between if needed)

• Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer frequently in and outside the gym.

• Avoid touching your face.

• Sneeze or cough into a tissue, or in the inside of their elbow. (Wash hands or use hand sanitizer immediately after)

• Disinfect and wash frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible, such as: gear bag, water bottle, mouth guard, belt, and gym footwear.

• Bring your own face towel to dry any perspiration.

• Be thoughtful of any early symptoms before training. (Do not attend training sessions if you exhibit any of the following symptoms: Fever or chills, Cough, Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, Fatigue, Muscle or body aches, Headache, loss of taste or smell, Sore throat, Congestion or runny nose, Nausea or vomiting, Diarrhea)
