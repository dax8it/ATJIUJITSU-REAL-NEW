# Judo

• Judo is a tremendous and dynamic combat sport that demands both physical prowess and great mental discipline. From a standing position, it involves techniques that allow you to lift and throw your opponents onto their backs.

• Judo does not involve kicking, punching, or striking techniques of any kind.

• Instead, judo simply involves two individuals who, by gripping the judo uniform, use the forces of balance, power, and movement to attempt to subdue each other. Thus,it is simple and basic.

• Judo is incorporated into our Jiu-Jitsu classes
