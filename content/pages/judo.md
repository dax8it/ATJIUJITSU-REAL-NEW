• Judo is a tremendous and dynamic combat sport that demands both physical prowess and great mental discipline. From a standing position, it involves techniques that allow you to lift and throw your opponents onto their backs.

• Judo does not involve kicking, punching, or striking techniques of any kind.

• Instead, judo simply involves two individuals who, by gripping the judo uniform, use the forces of balance, power, and movement to attempt to subdue each other. Thus,it is simple and basic. however, judo techniques often take considerable time, effort, and energy

• Judo is incorporated into most of our Jiu-Jitsu classes
