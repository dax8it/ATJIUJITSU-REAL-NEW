## With a mix of Jiu-Jitsu and Kickboxing combined, when taught in a controlled environment, MMA training is actually safer than other traditional sports and activities available for kids. Because of its real-world effectiveness and applications, your child is not only learning positive aspects that come from training a martial art, but they are learning a true form of self-defense that will stick with them for the rest of their lives.

**Please keep in mind, this class is for Ages 9-13 and 8 year old grey belts.** 

**In order to take this class you will need:**

**\- MMA Gloves**

**\- A Mouthpiece**

**\- Head Gear**

**\- Shin Guards (Muay-Thai Shin guards are allowed)**

These items are a requirement and essential to MMA, you cannot take the class without all of the proper gear. We do sell Kids MMA gloves and shin pads, so please feel free to ask us if you are interested in buying!

We are very excited to have this new addition of class into our school. It will be a different experience and new learning perspective. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!
