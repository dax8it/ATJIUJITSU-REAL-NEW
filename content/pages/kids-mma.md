## MMA is a full-contact combat sport which includes a mix of striking, grappling and ground fighting. For kids who primarily take our Jiu-Jitsu classes this will be a great way to introduce them into mixing the martial arts. When taught in a controlled environment, MMA training is actually safer than other traditional sports and activities available for kids. Because of its real-world effectiveness and applications, your child is not only learning positive aspects that come from training a martial art, but they are learning a true form of self-defense that will stick with them for the rest of their lives.

**Adult MMA Schedule:**

> **Friday: 6:15 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.**

**Kids MMA Schedule:**

> **Tuesday: 5:15 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.**
>
